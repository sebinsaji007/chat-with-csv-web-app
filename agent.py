            If the query requires creating a bar chart, reply as follows:
            {"bar": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}
            
            If the query requires creating a line chart, reply as follows:
            {"line": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

            {"answer": "The title with the highest rating is 'Gilead'"}
            
            If you do not know the answer, reply as follows:

            Return all output as a string.
            
            All strings in "columns" list and data list, should be in double quotes,
